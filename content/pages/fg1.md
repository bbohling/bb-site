## December 2025 Roast

**Costa Rica Zarcero Monte Brisas Danto**

I usually roast Guatemala beans to a Full City level, but this month I’m switching things up with a Costa Rica bean and experimenting with a lighter City roast. Here’s how Sweet Maria’s describes it:

> Well-balanced with a nuanced side that adds interest to the cup. Raw sugar sweetness, brisk acidity (light roasts), hints of apple, spiced chocolate, cocoa nibs, and toffee almond. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.
