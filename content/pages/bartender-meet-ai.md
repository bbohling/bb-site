blah blah blah

This was the question I asked ChatGPT:

> I'm looking for a delicious cocktail recipe that can leverage what I already have which includes: st. Germain, sweet vermouth, tequila blanco, tequila anejo, mezcal, bourbon, Campari, fresh squeezed orange, lemon and lime juice. of course of have some bitters and sweeteners like agave syrup, sugar, and maple syrup as well

The response was rather tasty:

Great news: with what you already have, you can make several fantastic cocktails without needing to buy anything else. Here are three highly-optimized, absolutely delicious recipes based on your ingredients — each with its own vibe (refreshing, spirit-forward, smoky).

## 🍹 1. Elderflower Margarita (St-Germain Margarita) — Bright & Floral

_A riff on a classic margarita but upgraded with St-Germain._

### Ingredients

- 2 oz tequila blanco
- 0.5 oz St-Germain
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 0.5 oz agave syrup
- Optional: tiny dash of orange juice (⅛ oz) for roundness

### Instructions

- Shake all ingredients with ice.
- Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.
- Garnish with lime wheel or a small strip of orange peel.

_Why it works_: St-Germain replaces triple sec with floral complexity while keeping the core structure of a margarita.

## 🍊 2. Bourbon Elderflower Sour — Smooth & Crowd-Pleasing

_Think whiskey sour, but more elegant._

### Ingredients

- 2 oz bourbon
- 0.75 oz St-Germain
- 0.75 oz lemon juice
- 0.25 oz simple syrup or maple syrup
- Optional: 1 dash Angostura bitters
- Optional: egg white for foam

### Instructions

- Shake all ingredients with ice (dry shake first if using egg white).
- Strain into a coupe or rocks glass.
- Express a lemon peel over the top.

_Why it works_: St-Germain softens bourbon’s edges, making a silky, aromatic sour.

## 🔥 3. Mezcal Negroni Variation (Mezcal Rosita) — Smoky & Complex

_This is incredibly good with your exact ingredients._

### Ingredients

- 1 oz mezcal
- 1 oz Campari
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- Optional: 1 bar spoon St-Germain (adds subtle floral lift)
- Orange peel garnish

### Instructions

- Stir with ice until cold.
- Serve over a large cube in a rocks glass.
- Express orange peel on top.

_Why it works_: Mezcal’s smokiness turns the classic Negroni into a sophisticated, slow-sipping drink.
