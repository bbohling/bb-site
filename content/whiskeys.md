Oddly, I started my journey in this line of liquors with scotch and have since switched. I believe most people _graduate_ into scotch, but maybe I'm wrong or just an oddball. Either way, below is a breakdown of some of my current recommendations. Please let me know what your favorites are so I can continue to update my list.

## Overall Best Bang for the Buck

**Buffalo Trace**: it is hard to beat Buffalo Trace for the money. It is great served neat or in a cocktail and probably one of the least _offensive_ on this page.

## Current Favorites

* Bib & Tucker
* Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon
* Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky
* Nikka Whisky from the Barrel

## Favorite Ryes

* Whistle Pig Rye
* Sazerac Rye

## Great Value

* Buffalo Trace
* Benchmark
* Eagle Rare

## Most Drinkable

Need something that _most_ people can drink? These are smooth and least opinionated.

* Basil Hayden's
* Buffalo Trace
* Woodford Reserve
* Jefferson's Ocean Bourbon

## Small Distilleries

Obviously this one will likely change the most as I get opportunities to taste more around the globe.

* Hatch - Egg Harbor, Wisconsin
* Bainbridge Battle Point - Bainbridge, Washington

## Cocktails

If I'm making a Kentucky Mule, Old Fashion, or Sazerac these are typically my go tos: 

* Basil Hayden's
* Buffalo Trace
* Sazerac Rye
* Bulleit Rye

## Honorable Mentions

* 1792 Small Batch
* Four Roses Single Barrel
* Angel's Envy
* Elijah Craig Small Batch
