As I have mentioned in the past, I have typically taken full control
over both web presence and content management (mainly photos). However,
I am exploring the notion of leveraging photo sharing sites mainly for
backups and video sites so I donâ€™t have to take up a lot of hard drive
space. I will have a much more in-depth post soon on this topic, but I
came across this video from one of my favorite tutorial websites,
[Common Craft](http://www.commoncraft.com/ "Common Craft"), that I just
had to share.

For anyone that has been doing photography and an active participant of
the social web lately this will not be anything new, but it is so well
done I felt compelled to share.
