![Canon EOS 5D Mark II](/uploads/2010/08/Canon5DMarkII_01.jpg "Canon 5D Mark II")

I am so very frustrated right now. I just spent 30 minutes typing up this post on my iPad and only the photo came through...NONE of the text. Well now I have a new post, "Why I Threw My iPad Out the Window!"

I'll try to rewrite about this topic later. It only took me a month to write it in the first place. It will probably take another 2 months for me to muster up the will power to rewrite about this. Dammit!
