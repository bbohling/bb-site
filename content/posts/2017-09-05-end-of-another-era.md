This weekend I ditched Jekyll (again) as my preferred tool for my site. It truly is comical how many times I have switched blogging tools. I have been blogging since 2001 and have switched tools dozens of times. I still have _most_ of my posts too, so I hope to compile all my content here eventually. More importantly though, I want to start writing more regularly again. And the only way that is going to happen is if I remove as much friction as possible including perfection. So excuse the design imperfections and the inevitable grammar mistakes as I ramp back up.
