      <title>DIRECTV NOW: Initial Thoughts</title>

      <description>DIRECTV released DIRECTV NOW today and I jumped on their Go Big deal. For $35 (normally $60) you get over 100 channels; some you can stream live and some have on-demand content. I have not had cable for years and while we recently gained access to some local channels via an antenna the biggest thing that I have missed is sports. Every year I pay for MLB, MLS, and NBC Sports Gold (for cycling), but obviously that is still limiting.</description>

      <title>Deploying Angular Using http-server, Nginx, and PM2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2016-07-11-ng-nginx-pm2/</link>

      <description>Since it took about an hour to put all the pieces together correctly I thought it best to document how I deployed an Angular (version 2) app using http-server, pm2, and nginx. In my case I deployed to an Ubuntu server hosted on DigitalOcean, but these instructions should work the same as long as you have the other components installed correctly.
 I am not an expert on this topic.</description>

      <title>A Useful Desktop with Ubersicht</title>

      <description>Ubersicht is an OS X utility that allows you to display dynamic (or static) content on your desktop. In the screenshot below I have some static content for a color palette and Git commit standards; all text being selectable. Possibly more interesting though are the other widgets that are always changing. Take the two Strava widgets at the bottom of the screen. One widget allows me to quickly see how my 2016 cycling compares to 2015 and the other just displays some key data from the current year.</description>

      <description>Feeling the urge to blog again, but of course I cannot just write. First, I have to play with the many different blogging engines. Then pick one. Then research all the ways I can tweak it and optimize my workflow. Then try to migrate my many years of blogging (I recently found &amp;ldquo;blogging&amp;rdquo; content from a website I did back in 1997&amp;hellip;wow are those images low-res). Finally, start writing. Here&amp;rsquo;s to completing step 1.</description>

      <description>Even though I have probably set up a new Mac at least a dozen times in the last few years I keep forgetting the most basic step in the world of Terminal&amp;hellip;creating a .bash_profile and adding an export path. This is key because it tells Terminal where to look for executable binaries. Hopefully writing the steps down will make sure I never forget this again.
 Open TextEdit (or your favorite text editor) Add export PATH=&amp;quot;$HOME/bin:$PATH&amp;quot; on the first line Save in your home directory (~/) as .</description>

      <description>After months of experiencing Visual Studio 2012 (running inside Parallels on my Mac) hanging when trying to exit out of the app I took a few minutes to look for a fix. Within a couple of minutes I came across this thread which contained the solution to the issue. Based on the thread it seems like the root cause of this issue is that I am working on solutions that are stored on my Mac, \\psf\Home\pathToSoltion rather than working on solutions that are on the Windows (VM) C drive.</description>

      <description>On and off for several days now I have been trying to fix an issue where a drop down list (&amp;lt;select&amp;gt; tag) seems to be disabled on old (version 2.x) Android devices. Apparently this is a known bug with plenty of suggested fixes. Not a single one (or combination) worked for me. I even came across this suggestion since we are using iScroll, but it did not help either.</description>

      <description>I just spent the last few days in sunny San Diego. Instead of enjoying the outdoor activities though, I was in a large room with hundreds of other people learning about the latest in standards-based web design. The conference, An Event Apart (AEA), had twelve top-notch speakers including Jeffrey Zeldman and Eric Meyer who started the conference. In my 18 years of being a professional web guy I have been to many conferences, but without a doubt AEA was my favorite&amp;hellip;even better than WWDC.</description>

      <description>I wanted to create an encrypted disk image for my 2012 Tax Return documents, but unfortunately Disk Utility, which comes with OSX, does not allow image sizes (that are encrypted and journal HFS+) less than 10.5 MB. This seemed strange, so I looked for the command line equivalent. With the help of this article I came up with this:
hdiutil create -encryption -size 5m -volname 2012Taxes 2012Taxes.dmg -srcfolder ~/Desktop/foo/ -fs HFS+J   5M = disk image size (5 MB) 2012Taxes = disk image name when mounted 2012Taxes.</description>

      <description>Since everyone is talking about shipping these days tonight I took the plunge and released my modified blog on a new server. I have been dreading this day because a) the redesign is incomplete and b) there are so many steps in cleanly moving a domain between providers. Of course, immediately after &amp;ldquo;flipping the switch&amp;rdquo; I realized that my old website used URLs like /2011/09/25/Ellie/, but my new configuration was setup to use /2011/09/Ellie/ (notice I no longer have a day in the URL).</description>

If you are developing solutions using JavaScript I highly recommend you check out two helpful libraries: Underscore and Moment.</description>

      <description>My MacBook Pro is setup with two user accounts: one for personal and one for work. This is certainly not my setup of choice, but if I want to use my own MBP (which is retina) at work then I have to abide by this rule.
Anyway, this setup caused an issue when I went to do something that required Homebrew. After a little research and testing Leif Hanack had the best answer.</description>

      <description>ImageOptim is a fantastic utility to reduce the size of your images without impacting image quality1. I use it both for my web and iOS work, but it was not until today that I made it even better.
My Old Workflow  Save whatever image I was working on to some folder Open ImageOptim Drag the image onto ImageOptim canvas ImageOptim does its work I move the optimized image to its final destination  My New Workflow  Save whatever image I was working on to an “optimize” folder Hazel automatically moves to an “optimized” folder Hazel automatically kicks off ImageOptim and it optimizes the image I move the optimized image to its final destination  My responsibilities went from four steps to two; a 50% reduction.</description>

      <description>At work I was wading through a very old code base and was curious how many lines of code it contained. Not wanting to open the seemingly endless list of files in the solution, I went looking for a quick-n-dirty way to count the lines of code in the solution. Preferring a command-line approach than installing a utility that I would likely rarely use, I found this simple powershell snippet:</description>

      <description>While a single change cannot take credit, it was a single change that was the catalyst to my rekindled passion for photography. In large part, the changes reduced the friction of taking photos and doing something with the photos. This is going to take some time, but hopefully anyone can learn at least one little nugget.
A Brief History To understand my recent changes it would help to at least know a little bit about my photography background.</description>

      <description>We loved living in Arizona, but there is no denying that we have a fantastic view from our home in Oregon. Over the last few months I have switched from Aperture to Lightroom which makes photos like this even easier.

      <description>If you are lucky enough to be in the market for a new notebook, Apple just made your choice a lot more difficult. Last year I gave up my MacBook Pro and switched to the MacBook Air and have not regretted it one bit. I use my Air primarily for photography1 but from time-to-time I do use Final Cut Pro X to create small family videos. I still use a MacBook Pro for work which is a major bummer because it really isn&amp;rsquo;t any faster but feels like a giant brick.</description>

      <description>I just had a progasm1. I was creating a UITableView that had multiple groups with multiple rows in each group. Each row had a UISwitch. The intent was to update a price label every time a UISwitch value (on/off) changed. However, figuring out which row and section, trigged the event was not straightforward. After doing some research it seemed like most people were using a hack where they would set the UISwitch tag property to the indexPath.</description>

      <description>Nearly two years ago I wrote about how the iPhone greatly impacted the usage of my Canon 5D Mark II. A quick summary: the iPhone camera got to be so good that I used it instead of my DSLR not only because of the photo quality but because of how easy it was then to post photos online. Fortunately technology changes.
Canon 5D Mark III + Eye-Fi = AWESOMENESS I have had my eye on the Eye-Fi for years.</description>

 speedlimit is a Leopard [works on Lion too] preference pane for limiting your network bandwidth to one of a couple different speeds—768k DSL, Edge, 3G, and Dialup. This is really handy for testing your iPhone app under normal Edge network conditions in the iPhone Simulator. The new version allows you to restrict the slowdown to only a specific set of hosts.</description>

      <description>This has been a big week of knocking down the Jekyll publishing barriers. Automating the Jekyll publishing process was the first big one. As I stated in that post, it still is not perfect, but much, much better than the default Jekyll behavior. Next, I tweaked Jekyll so I could publish link posts, but what good is that feature unless I can publish them lickety-split? Luckily I remembered that Ben Brooks posted on this topic recently (turns out it was just over a year ago).</description>

      <description>Now that I have Jekyll publishing automated, why not do link posts? For one, Jekyll does not support link posts out of the box. However, Tuan Anh figured out how to tweak Jekyll to support link posts: Posting Link Post in Jekyll by Tuan Anh Tran.
This is the code I used to modify my post.html file (in the _layouts directory):
 &amp;#123;&amp;#37; if page.link &amp;#37;&amp;#125; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&#34;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; page.link &amp;#125;&amp;#125;&#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; page.</description>

Since switching to Jekyll I have written a mere 28 times; a personal worst in my 9 years of blogging1. I would love to blame it on a busy life2, but that is a cop-out.</description>

 Add this (or any other) page as a bookmark Then click here to see the bookmarklet code and Select All → Copy Now edit that same bookmark, paste the code you just copied into the URL and name it something like “View Source”  This will most certainly be used. Thanks Ole!</description>

      <description>This has to be the best tip I have found sound far in 2012: How to find the hidden files on Mac OS X
 The Mac OS X operating system hides important system files to protect your computer. This is a measure meant to prevent you from modifying files that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be modified, or deleting files that your computer needs to run correctly. Occasionally, you may need to find a file that Mac OS X hides.</description>

      <description>This post is testing a new feature that I have added to my Jekyll workflow. I have created an Automator workflow (that is actually a folder action) that assists in auto publishing my blog posts. This new setup not only removes steps in my blogging workflow, but also allows me to post from my iOS devices as well. Additionally, I am testing the use of dictation on my iPad to see if it will further reduce the barriers of blogging.</description>

      <description>I never, ever would have thought I would have a tooth extracted at age 41. For as long as I remember I have seen a dentist every six months, I have only had one tiny cavity in my life, and every checkup I have had the hygienist has commented on how healthy my teeth look. Certainly I owe a lot to my parents teaching me to brush and floss daily, giving me good genes and paying for braces.</description>

      <title>Final Cut Pro X on the MacBook Air: A Follow-Up</title>

      <description>My post, Final Cut Pro X on a MacBook Air, has received a surprising amount of traffic. So I thought I would provide a brief follow-up that covers why I purchased FCP X and how it has been performing on my MacBook Air.
FCP X vs. iMovie Like I mentioned before, I am no videographer and I probably have no real reason to spend $300 on video editing software. iMovie is incredibly simple to use and can make great videos fast, but it seemed hard to do simple tasks I wanted to do and lacked features I was after.</description>

      <title>Need Lens Advice for a Canon DSLR?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2011-10-29-lens-advice-canon-dslr/</link>

      <description>Not that I am an expert, but I often get asked photography related questions. A commonly asked question: What lens should I buy? Of course, there is not a single answer for everyone. I do have a single, initial response though: Buy the best lens you can afford 1. I have had many camera bodies, but for the most part have had the same lenses since 2001, so consider your lens purchase a long-term investment.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned previously, I have always loved bikes. The previous five years though I have ridden very little. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I rode my road bike less than 500 miles each year. However, this year has been a big cycling year for me&amp;hellip;I have ridden over 2,000 miles! I even dusted off the neglected mountain bike and went for a night ride on it a few weeks ago. In addition, I was convinced by my fellow riders to try cyclocross.</description>

      <description>This past Friday, almost 16 years to-the-day from our last time, we brought home a new puppy; a yellow English lab. We got her from Allison Hillius of Devonshire Labradors. After spending a couple of days with her we have named her Ellie (after a landslide vote from friends and family). She just turned seven weeks old today so the next couple of weeks will be quite tiring as she will need constant supervision and let out to go potty every two to three hours.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we all need a little bit of inspiration to motivate us to be productive. Recently I have leveraged two sources for finding some fantastic photography for inspiration: Google+ and 500px.
Google+ The big two social networks have a very fine grain purpose for me&amp;hellip;Twitter to keep tabs with technology and Facebook to communicate with a few friends and family members. The newest kid on the block, Google+1, currently is my favorite place to find inspiring photos.</description>

 I have been a Vimeo Plus member since November 2007 yet I have only posted 65 videos. All have been posted with the simplest of tools: iMovie, iMovie for iOS, Vimeo for iOS, etc. I purchased Final Cut Pro X on July 2 and today was the first time I used it. Today I used about 0.</description>

I describe most of my reasons1 in my post, Text File Revolution so I won&amp;rsquo;t rehash again, however, I did want to write a little tutorial on how to get Jekyll up and running on your Mac2.
Pre-Requisite: XCode The easiest way to get a hold of XCode is to download from the Mac App Store.</description>

      <description>OK, based on my last post I should be reading right now. Instead, I wanted to write this post since several friends have asked for my opinions on photography recently. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying I am simply an enthusiast when it comes to photography. I am not in a position to share techniques to make you a better photographer. However, I have purchased a fair share of gear so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my tips to those looking into getting photography&amp;hellip;specifically those wanting to upgrade to a DSLR.</description>

If you want to know what the really smart people are saying about the event I suggest you start by reading Ben Brook&amp;rsquo;s WWDC: The Big Stuff or simply catch the video highlights of the 117-minute keynote in 8 minutes.
I would like to share my thoughts on iCloud and its implications in context of the evolution of the file system.</description>

Each day we enjoyed a fantastic view of the Columbia River and even caught a glimpse of Mt. Adams on Saturday (bottom-left photo). If you want a view and be just a few blocks from downtown Hood River I highly recommend checking out the Riverdell Vacation Rental!
Every day we walked from Riverdell to downtown whether to shop1 or feed ourselves (or both).</description>

And as much as I like Stumptown I also get bored with the same thing over and over. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love exploring the many, many, many options I have nearby. This past weekend it was Coava. In their own words&amp;hellip;
 Coava is a family of hard working people who love coffee.</description>

      <description>Bikes have always played a large part in my life. I vividly remember each bike all the way back to my first Big Wheel1&amp;hellip;one of the originals in the early 70s. The first monumental bike purchase for me occurred in 1982. For a year I had been working on my parents and grandparents to buy me a Honda three wheeler. I was totally consumed with the idea of having my own three wheeler&amp;hellip;my cousin had three Honda ATVs which I loved to ride anytime we went to his house.</description>

After hours and hours (and hours) of dinking around I decided to try Google&amp;rsquo;s web fonts versus me hosting them. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes&amp;hellip;it slightly goes against the simplicity that I am after with this site, but I still feel compelled to try.</description>

Along with the photo I will include what that thing means to me and/or why it is important. I’m sure this isn’t a unique project but I think it will be a wonderful exercise to focus my photography and writing passions. It will also expose my life in new ways.</description>

      <description>We are all very, very busy these days. We fill our time with work, friends, and family. Any spare time we fill with hobbies, TV, and of course the Internet. Many of these activities lead to consuming and generating copious amounts of digital content as I have mentioned before. It is the generating of so much digital content that is overwhelming to me. It leads to more time to manage the content.</description>

I was migrating last month&amp;rsquo;s photos from my MacBook Pro to our iMac (probably time for another photo workflow post) when I randomly thought about a photo trip Denise and I took back in 2002. About 12-15 of us from the Intel Arizona Photography Club (or something like that) took a trip in Northern Arizona. In two days we shot at Painted Desert, Canyon de Chelly, Glen Canyon, Antelope Canyon, and Monument Valley.</description>

      <description>I really like how Jon Hicks handles comments on Hicksdesign. Instead of allowing direct comments on his blog he provides a link that pre-populates a tweet. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of blog comments and many agree. Alex Payne states why best:
 For most sites, though, comments are worse than useless. The anonymity of the Internet inspires hit-and-run attacks, unintelligible ramblings, and truckloads of spam.
 So I wanted to implement a similar feature on this site.</description>

For the most part I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change this about me; it generates intense passion in my daily life as well as serving me well in my career. However, there are certainly pitfalls I inevitably fall into time and time again. The most prevalent is my constant tinkering with my online presence.

      <description>Last weekend we took a little drive on the Historic Columbia River Highway which is just east of Portland (about 50 minutes from Forest Grove). It had been several years since we had been on it, which is an absolute shame. In less than four hours we can drive, hike, eat, and take photos of dozens of falls, bridges, trails, and other breathtaking views. How easy it is to take those things for granted.</description>

      <description>We have lived in our house for over five years now and yet we still do not have a proper living room. Of course, we have a living room, but not one that entices people to sit down and relax. This is horribly unfortunate since the room has a huge picture window that has a fabulous view of the Coast Range; one of the two main selling points of the house (huge kitchen was another one).</description>

      <description>Note: this was originally posted here.
Denise and I received our iPhone 4s on Day 1. The very day we left for a long weekend at Crater Lake. And the weekend after that we spent 10 days on in Door County. In a typical month this year we take around 800 photos (and that is WAY down from previous years) with our Canon 5D Mark II. On vacations we typically take 1000+ photos.</description>

      <description>I am so very frustrated right now. I just spent 30 minutes typing up this post on my iPad and only the photo came through&amp;hellip;NONE of the text. Well now I have a new post, &amp;ldquo;Why I Threw My iPad Out the Window!&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to rewrite about this topic later. It only took me a month to write it in the first place. It will probably take another 2 months for me to muster up the will power to rewrite about this.</description>

      <title>Is it best to leverage social networks</title>

      <description>For years I have been developing my own web sites and hosting my own content (text, photos, and videos). I guess I took this approach mainly so I would have full control over everything&amp;hellip;us developers can be a little power hungry at times. Sometimes I have different sites (URLs) with specific content for each and sometimes I cram everything together, but before I go into any further details, let&amp;rsquo;s look at some of the purposes of my site(s).</description>

      <description>I only have a few minutes before lunch is over, but had to share&amp;hellip;my new espresso machine and grinder finally arrived. After three weeks of no spro at home, relief is finally here. I will post much more (first impressions, videos, and more photos) in the next few days, but just had to share my joy.
These photos aren&amp;rsquo;t great, but I&amp;rsquo;m racing to get everything setup over lunch so I can have play time tonight!</description>

      <title>Online Photo Sharing and Common Craft</title>

      <description>As I have mentioned in the past, I have typically taken full control over both web presence and content management (mainly photos). However, I am exploring the notion of leveraging photo sharing sites mainly for backups and video sites so I don’t have to take up a lot of hard drive space. I will have a much more in-depth post soon on this topic, but I came across this video from one of my favorite tutorial websites, Common Craft, that I just had to share.</description>

      <title>Got ExpressionEngine? Need a sitemap index?</title>

      <description>If you have been developing web sites for a while you already undoubtedly know the importance of sitemaps. Most blog software, such as Wordpress, provide plugins to auto generate sitemaps, but I could not find one for ExpressionEngine so I am here to explain how to auto generate your own with ExpressionEngine.
To create a simple sitemap for a SINGLE blog in ExpressionEngine you can follow the instructions explained here.</description>

      <description>Most often I am willing to pay a premium for a product or service that has excellent customer support. This is one (of many) reasons I buy Apple products. On a couple of occasions I have had a small issue with one of their products, I walk into a store, and they have immediately replaced it with a brand new product…it doesn’t get any better than that does it?
For the last several months I have been working on this web site as well as switching hosting providers.</description>

      <description>There is no other consumer espresso machine that has a bigger customer base nor the cult following than the Rancilio Silvia (aka Miss Silvia). Just do a Google search on Rancilio Silvia or the more common name Miss Silvia and you will start to see what I mean. Arguably it is the best home espresso machine for the money. However, she can be a bit fussy at times.
Pulling the shot In my previous post, Taming Rancilio Rocky, I mentioned how important the grinder is to making exceptional espressos.</description>

      <description>As I stated in my previous post, I no longer possess Miss Silvia and Rocky…however, I still have plenty of friends that do own the duo so I wanted to share the knowledge I have gained in the last few years with them. First, I have to admit that I have learned more in the last month than I had in the past few years all because of one phenomenon: YouTube.</description>

      <description>Much has changed on the Web since I created my first web site in 1995. If only I would have taken screenshots my first site (or any of the hundreds that came after). Oh the days of the simple HTML tags: H1, p, img, br, etc. No Javascript, no CSS, no tables that I remember. Now, over a decade later, there are so many technologies a web developer/designer can use! There are hundreds (thousands?</description>

      <description>We are still working on adding a bunch more features to our web site, but we accomplished enough over the last few days to release a set of changes to celebrate the new year! Yeah, while you were hooping it up last night we were working on the site, so if you feel sorry for us please send wine.
Most of the work was behind-the-scenes so you, the reader, will never know why in the world so many hours was spent on these tasks.</description>

      <description>Several years ago one of my fellow photographers, Cecil Walker, showed me an easy, but priceless photo editing tip. I wish one of us could take credit for this, but unfortunately we can’t—nonetheless I’m glad Cecil came across the article. I’m sorry I do not remember where, so apologies to the original “founder”. All photographers, on occasion (ha), take a flat photo…I know, shocking. With a quick 2–step tweak the flat photo can be reborn into the image you really witnessed.</description>

      <description>I have a Japanese Maple outside my (home) office window. For about a week now I have noticed the morning sun illuminating its beautiful limbs, buds, morning (more like all day) dew. Each day I would say to myself, “I should capture that moment with my camera (Canon EOS 20D).” I finally did or at least I finally attempted to, I’m hoping you will let me know what you think of the outcome.</description>

      <description>Now that we will be leaving Arizona within four days we are hitting our favorite restaurants one last time. One of our favorite places to get dessert is Angel Sweet—we’ve been going there for a couple of years now and they are easily the best place to get gelato in the Phoenix area. Owned by an ASU grad, Hiro, I cannot remember the Italian company, but I do remember that it is the only one in the entire United States.</description>

      <description>For those that have not heard, this week we say good-bye to Arizona—our home of nine years! While we will greatly miss our friends here in Arizona and our many favorite destinations of the beautiful Southwest…we are extremely excite about our next chapter (or better yet, book) of the Northwest. To be honest, our decision to move out of state happened rather quickly (about two months) and is rather complex. Fortunately we work for Intel so our jobs will remain the same (there is a several Intel campuses within 30 minutes of our house in Forest Grove), but it was the need for personal changes that drove the decision.</description>

      <description>I just returned from a six day trip to Costa Rica. Unfortunately it was for work so I did not have much free time. However, I did manage to set aside some time for photography. In the next week I will work on posting a gallery&amp;hellip;though I should work on an Alaska gallery considering that trip was months ago. I did post several photos from Costa Rica on my photo blog though: http://blog.</description>
