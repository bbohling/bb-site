            <div id="content">
                <p>Bikes have always played a large part in my life. I vividly remember each bike all the way back to my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Wheel" title="Big Wheel">Big Wheel</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:fn-1">1</a></sup>&hellip;one of the <a href="http://www.originalbigwheel.com/" title="Original Big Wheel">originals</a> in the early 70s. The first monumental bike purchase for me occurred in 1982. For a year I had been working on my parents and grandparents to buy me a <a href="http://brndn.me/3wheeler" title="Honda Three Wheeler">Honda three wheeler</a>. I was totally consumed with the idea of having my own three wheeler&hellip;my cousin had three Honda ATVs which I loved to ride anytime we went to his house. Just as everyone was about to break down and buy me an ATV the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/" title="E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial">E.T.</a> came out. Remember how cool all the bike scenes were? Well, my tune changed&hellip;now I wanted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwahara_(bicycle_company)" title="Kuwahara">Kuwahara</a> more than anything else.</p>

<p>I think I could get amnesia, forget the name of all my friends and family (even my own) and I would still remember this moment. My parents and grandparents asked me if I was sure I wanted a BMX&hellip;OR would I  rather have a three wheeler. Yes, they were actually (finally) prepared to buy me a three wheeler! Whoa. This should be an easy choice, right?  After all, I already had a BMX bike (though a 2 ton brick of a bike), so, logically it made more sense to get an ATV. Then again, when do 12 year olds act logically? Without any hesitation at all I whole heartily stated I wanted a Kuwahara BMX bike. My parents and grandparents were no fools when it came to figuring out the financial consequence of my choice so that very day I had a shiny, chrome Kuwahara with white and blue lettering. It was gorgeous. I rode that bike throughout my middle school and high school years. And I can honestly say that to this day I do not regret my decision. If for no other reason than I surely would have hospitalized myself (if not worse) if I had a three wheeler at age 12.</p>

<p>Certainly my memories of the Kuwara do not end there. My most memorable moment with that bike was when my friend and I built a ramp from a sawhorse and sheet of plywood. What I quickly learned about our choice in materials, as I hit the plywood, was the <em>springiness</em> of a sheet of plywood. I was launched halfway to the moon but fortunately landed upright without crashing (or hurting my man parts). However, I landed with such force that I blew out both tires. And while this is one of many similar stories I have with that bike, I never once ended up in the hospital. Well, at least not until I was an adult (a story for another post).</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve had quite a few bike and while I love them all and could share many stories<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:fn-2">2</a></sup> it wasn&rsquo;t until the end of 2010 that I had my next monumental bike purchase.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2011/05/20110511-IMG_2380.jpg" alt="CycleOps 400 Pro Indoor Trainer" /></p>

<p>When we moved from Arizona to Oregon in 2005 I transitioned from mountain bike rider to roadie<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:fn-3">3</a></sup> which I thought I would never do. I mean us mountain bikers were laid back, flannel wearing, cool kids&hellip;unlike those uptight, outfit matching, snob roadies! All it took though was a single ride with a group of local cyclists, blazing around the beautiful country side in Forest Grove and I was hooked. The first road bike I got was quickly upgraded the very next year. Not wanting to continue that horribly expensive trend I looked at cheap (at least that was the original intent) alternatives. I started getting computers and gizmos for my bike to aid in improving my performance&hellip;I was getting tired of getting left behind. Well, like most <a href="/2008/01/new-spro-gear-here/" title="La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi II espresso machine">things I do</a> I got carried away.</p>

<p><em>A little sidebar to explain how I function&hellip;</em></p>

<p>I am very competitive&hellip;especially when it comes to athletics. I was a cross country runner during my high school and college years. And while I do some competitive running and cycling today, I really like competing with myself on a day-to-day basis and my favorite way to do that is with data. Unfortunately, simply writing down my workouts is not good enough. I want technology involved. I want data collected automatically. This is why, when I bought a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/769753/kinetic-road-machine-fluid-bike-trainer" title="Kinetic Road Machine Fluid Bike Trainer">trainer</a> to train indoors I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied for very long. Not only was I highly restricted on the data I could collect, it was completely manual.</p>

<p><em>And so&hellip;</em></p>

<p>One thing led to another and soon I was determined that I needed the <a href="http://brndn.me/400pro" title="CycleOps 400 Pro Indoor Cycle">CycleOps 400 Pro</a>. The amount of data the 400 Pro collects is insane. Totally for a pro, which I clearly am not. However, the geek in me won out in the end (read: miraculously convinced Denise) and I purchased the state-of-the-art machine. Months later I am still learning how to best leverage all the data. I also just recently spent another small fortunate on a setup that allows me to collect data from all my outdoor rides that I can now mimic indoors on the 400 Pro. In other words, any ride that I do on my outdoor road bike I can duplicate on the 400 Pro. You have to admit (geek/jock or not), that is so awesome, right!?</p>

<p>To wrap up this WAY-TOO-LONG post on my history with bikes, I&rsquo;d like to point out maybe the most important fact: my mom and dad still have my Kuwahara, which I intend on giving to Bryce in a year or two. Let the fun begin!</p>
