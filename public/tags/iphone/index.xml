      <description>Note: this was originally posted here.
Denise and I received our iPhone 4s on Day 1. The very day we left for a long weekend at Crater Lake. And the weekend after that we spent 10 days on in Door County. In a typical month this year we take around 800 photos (and that is WAY down from previous years) with our Canon 5D Mark II. On vacations we typically take 1000+ photos.</description>

      <description>I am so very frustrated right now. I just spent 30 minutes typing up this post on my iPad and only the photo came through&amp;hellip;NONE of the text. Well now I have a new post, &amp;ldquo;Why I Threw My iPad Out the Window!&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to rewrite about this topic later. It only took me a month to write it in the first place. It will probably take another 2 months for me to muster up the will power to rewrite about this.</description>
