      <description>As I mentioned previously, I have always loved bikes. The previous five years though I have ridden very little. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I rode my road bike less than 500 miles each year. However, this year has been a big cycling year for me&amp;hellip;I have ridden over 2,000 miles! I even dusted off the neglected mountain bike and went for a night ride on it a few weeks ago. In addition, I was convinced by my fellow riders to try cyclocross.</description>

      <description>Bikes have always played a large part in my life. I vividly remember each bike all the way back to my first Big Wheel1&amp;hellip;one of the originals in the early 70s. The first monumental bike purchase for me occurred in 1982. For a year I had been working on my parents and grandparents to buy me a Honda three wheeler. I was totally consumed with the idea of having my own three wheeler&amp;hellip;my cousin had three Honda ATVs which I loved to ride anytime we went to his house.</description>
