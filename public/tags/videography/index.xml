      <description>My post, Final Cut Pro X on a MacBook Air, has received a surprising amount of traffic. So I thought I would provide a brief follow-up that covers why I purchased FCP X and how it has been performing on my MacBook Air.
FCP X vs. iMovie Like I mentioned before, I am no videographer and I probably have no real reason to spend $300 on video editing software. iMovie is incredibly simple to use and can make great videos fast, but it seemed hard to do simple tasks I wanted to do and lacked features I was after.</description>

      <description>When it comes to video editing I am a complete novice. A few supporting facts:
 I have been a Vimeo Plus member since November 2007 yet I have only posted 65 videos. All have been posted with the simplest of tools: iMovie, iMovie for iOS, Vimeo for iOS, etc. I purchased Final Cut Pro X on July 2 and today was the first time I used it. Today I used about 0.</description>

      <description>Friday at 6:00 PM we decided to see if there were any rooms available at the Surfsand Resort in Cannon Beach. This was while we were still at Bryce&amp;rsquo;s swimming lessons. By 8:10 PM Denise was checking us into our room at the resort. Yeah, even with a 4 year old&amp;hellip;we still got it!
All photos and videos taken with an iPhone 4 or iPad 2. Video created with iMovie for the iPad.</description>

      <description>As I have mentioned in the past, I have typically taken full control over both web presence and content management (mainly photos). However, I am exploring the notion of leveraging photo sharing sites mainly for backups and video sites so I donâ€™t have to take up a lot of hard drive space. I will have a much more in-depth post soon on this topic, but I came across this video from one of my favorite tutorial websites, Common Craft, that I just had to share.</description>
